# Coursera
> Heroku [link](https://whispering-reef-71036.herokuapp.com/#/) .
>There could be some problems on heroku requesting the images so it would be nice to serve it locally and check.


>To check simply npm install and run index.js


 - Cross origin requests were blocked on coursera api and no jsonp support was there so used nodejs as backend to make the server side requests.
  - Requests a data of size 100 and sort it into categories and serve catalog and categories route from the main controller.  
  - Search and site routes are taken care by the search and site controllers
  - A lot could have been done but this is what I have come up with, feed back is appreciated.
